    "**Let's say we have K people and we have to find the probability that 2 people have same birthdays**  \n",
    "*Exclude Feb 29 and assume other 365 days are equally likely; assume independence of birth*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If K>365, then probability is 1(pigeonhole principle in Mathematics)  \n",
    "\n",
    "let $K\\leq365$, P(nomatch) = $\\frac{365.364.363....(365-k+1)}{365^k}$  \n",
    "*EXplanation:*\n",
    "The total number of birthday combinations for k people will be $365^k$ because multiple people can have same birthdays. So, it's like choosing k from n object, with replacement where order doesn't matter.\n",
    "This is be the denomenator of the probability.\n",
    "For the numerator, the first person out of K people can be choosen such that there are no birthday match in 365 ways. Same way the second person can be choosen 364 ways and the third person in 363 ways and it goes on till the kth person whose birthday can have (365-k+1) days to get no match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "P(match) = 1 - P(nomatch) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\text{$50.7$%},  & \\text{if $K$=23} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{$97$%}, & \\text{if $K$=50} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{$99.9$%}, & \\text{if $K$=100}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason behind this surprising result is we are looking at the number of people K to guess the probability. But here the important this is to check how many possible pairs are possible among K people to look for that probability.\n",
    "So if we have 23 people than we have $23 \\choose 2$ = 253 pairs to check for common birthdays. Which gives us the probability more than 50% and it makes sense also."

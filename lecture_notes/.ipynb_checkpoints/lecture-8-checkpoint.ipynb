    "**1) Story Methode:** Mathematically speacking we are actually adding two functions. And if two functions have the same domain then we just find the result for the individual functions and we just add them up. So, as long as these two RVs are in the same sample space, it's absolutely fine to add them, subtract them or multiply etc. Intutively the first one is the number of successes in n trials and the second one is the the number of successes in m trials and both with probability of p. So, in total m+n trials and it's nothing but the addition of number of successes from first case to the number of successes of the second case.\n",

    "This is nothing but the sum of $(n+m)$ IID $Bern(p)$. And we know that the sum of $n$ IID $Bern(p)$ is nothing but $Bin(n,p)$. So for $(n+m)$ IID Bern(p) it will be $Bin(n+m,p)$.\n",
